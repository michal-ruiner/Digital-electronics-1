### 2-bit comparator truth table:

## 4-bit binary comparator

### VHDL architecture from design file:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of comparator_4bit is
begin
    B_less_A_o    <= '1' when (b_i < a_i) else '0';
    B_greater_A_o <= '1' when (b_i > a_i) else '0';
    B_equals_A_o  <= '1' when (b_i = a_i) else '0';

end architecture Behavioral;
```

### VHDL stimulus process from testbench file:

```vhdl
